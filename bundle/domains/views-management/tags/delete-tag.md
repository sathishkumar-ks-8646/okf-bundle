# Summary

**DELETE `/restapi/v2/workspaces/{workspace-id}/tags/{tag-id}`** - Delete Tag (Tags / Views Management).

Deletes a tag and every association it has.

**Path parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `<workspace-id>` | Long | ID of the workspace that owns the tag. |
| `<tag-id>` | Long | ID of the tag to delete. Must exist in `<workspace-id>`. |

From the OpenAPI specification:

Deletes a tag together with every association it has.

The views that carried the tag are untouched - only the label disappears from them. There is no undo, and re-creating the same name afterwards produces a different tag with a new identifier and none of the old associations. To clear a tag's links while keeping the tag, use the Remove Tag From Multiple Views API with dissociateAll instead.

# Request

## Headers

| Header | Value | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Authorization` | `Zoho-oauthtoken <access-token>` | Required | OAuth 2.0 access token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.delete`. See [Authentication](/foundations/authentication.md). |
| `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` | `<org-id>` | Required | Organization ID. Obtain it from [Get Org List](/domains/organization-management/org-info-and-settings/get-organizations.md). See [Identifiers](/foundations/identifiers.md). |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{workspace-id}` | string | ID of the workspace. | [How to obtain](/foundations/identifiers.md#workspace-id) |
| `{tag-id}` | string | ID of the tag. | [How to obtain](/foundations/identifiers.md#tag-id) |

## CONFIG Parameters

This endpoint takes no CONFIG parameter.

## Notes from the OpenAPI specification

- The calling user must be an Account Admin, Organization Admin or Workspace Admin of the workspace. Any other user fails with error code **8179**.
- The delete cascades to every association. The tag is silently removed from every view it labelled; the views themselves are untouched.
- The operation is irreversible, and the response does not report how many associations were removed. Call the Get Tagged Views API first to see what will be unlinked.
- Re-creating the same name afterwards produces a different tag with a new **tagId** and none of the old associations.
- To keep the tag but clear its links, use the Remove Tag From Multiple Views API with **dissociateAll** set to true instead.
- The tag-id in the request URI must belong to the workspace in the request URI. Tags are workspace-scoped, and a tag from another workspace fails with error code **8184**.
- One tag is deleted per call. There is no bulk-delete variant.
- The API returns HTTP 204 No Content with an empty body on success. Confirm with the Get Tags List API.

# Response

## Success Response

HTTP `204 No Content`. The response has no body; treat the status code alone as success. Failures still return the JSON error envelope described in [Response envelope](/foundations/response-envelope.md).

## Response Fields

**None.** This API returns `204 No Content` with an empty body. Confirm with [Get Tags List](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tags.md).

# Examples

## Sample Requests

```http
DELETE /restapi/v2/workspaces/320873000000419001/tags/320873000000425158 HTTP/1.1
Host: analyticsapi.zoho.com
Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.xxxxxx.yyyyyy
ZANALYTICS-ORGID: 700000123456
```

There is nothing else to send.

## Sample Responses

**HTTP 204 No Content — the tag was deleted**

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

**HTTP 200 OK — reading the tag list afterwards**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Get tags",
  "data": {
    "tags": []
  }
}
```

**HTTP 403 Forbidden — the tag does not exist**

```json
{
  "status": "failure",
  "summary": "VIEW_OR_TAG_NOT_PRESENT_IN_DB_TO_TAG",
  "data": {
    "errorCode": 8184,
    "errorMessage": "View/Tag not present or duplicated in db."
  }
}
```

## SDK Examples

Code samples in cURL, C#, Go, Java, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Deluge (Zoho scripting) are in [SDK examples for Delete Tag](/sdk-examples/views-management/tags/delete-tag.md). Client construction is described in [SDK clients](/foundations/sdk-clients.md).

# Notes & Behaviour

| Behaviour | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **It cascades to every association** | Deleting a tag silently removes it from every view it labelled. The views themselves are untouched — only the label disappears. |
| **There is no confirmation and no undo** | The response does not report how many associations were removed, and the tag cannot be restored. Read [Get Tagged Views](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tagged-views.md) first if you need to know the blast radius. |
| **Re-creating the name afterwards produces a different tag** | The new tag gets a new `tagId` and carries none of the old associations. |
| **To keep the tag but clear its links** | Use [Remove Tag From Multiple Views](/domains/views-management/tags/remove-tag-from-views.md) with `dissociateAll: true` instead. It removes every association without deleting the tag. |
| **One tag per call** | There is no bulk-delete variant. |
| **Dependency chain:** | [Get Tags List](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tags.md) → `<tag-id>` → (optionally [Get Tagged Views](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tagged-views.md) to see what will be unlinked) → Delete Tag. |

# Error Codes

Every failure returns HTTP 4xx/5xx with the JSON error envelope; `data.errorCode` carries the code below. Full definitions are in the [Error code catalog](/foundations/error-codes.md).

| Code | HTTP | Reason | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| [7005](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-7005) | 500 | Unexpected error on the Zoho Analytics server while processing an otherwise valid request. Not caused by the request payload. | Retry after a short interval. If the error persists, contact Zoho Analytics support quoting the error code and the time of the request. |
| [7103](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-7103) | 404 | `META_OBJECT_NOT_PRESENT` — The workspace does not exist. | Verify `<workspace-id>`. |
| [7301](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-7301) | 403 | `SECURITY_NOT_PERMITTED` — The caller cannot access the workspace. | Ensure the workspace is shared with the calling user. |
| [7390](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-7390) | 400 | `WORKSPACE_NOT_BELONGS_TO_ORG` — The workspace does not belong to the organization in `ZANALYTICS-ORGID`. | Send the organization ID that owns the workspace. |
| [8083](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-8083) | 400 | `ORGID_NOT_PRESENT_IN_THE_HEADER` — The `ZANALYTICS-ORGID` header is missing. | Add the header. |
| [8179](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-8179) | 403 | `DONT_HAVE_PERMISSION_TO_CREATE_TAGS` — The caller is not an Account Admin, Organization Admin, or Workspace Admin. | Call as an administrator of the workspace. |
| [8184](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-8184) | 403 | `VIEW_OR_TAG_NOT_PRESENT_IN_DB_TO_TAG` — The tag does not exist in this workspace. | Verify `<tag-id>` with [Get Tags List](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tags.md). |
| [8185](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-8185) | 400 | `CANNOT_DELETE_OR_UPDATE_TAG` — The delete matched no row. | Verify `<tag-id>` with [Get Tags List](/domains/views-management/tags/get-tags.md). |
| [8535](/foundations/error-codes.md#error-8535) | 401 | `INVALID_OAUTHTOKEN` — Invalid or expired OAuth token. | Provide a valid token carrying `ZohoAnalytics.modeling.delete`. |
